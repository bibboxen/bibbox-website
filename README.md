# Bibbox Website

Bibbox from a website.

## Description

This project a provides library self-service from a website. It consists of the
following parts:

- A frontend that exposes the library functions available to the user (React).
- An administration interface (for configuring machines) and website provider for the frontend (Symfony/PHP).
- An engine that handles communication between the frontend and FBS (FÃ¦lles bibliotekssystem) and handles state for each machine (Node.js).

A user can load a machine by a unique URL that is tied to a machine configuration.

![alt text](docs/architecture.png "Architecture")

The frontend communicates with the engine through a web socket.
The machine state flows from the engine to the frontend.
The frontend reflects the given machine state.
User actions passes from the frontend to the engine.
The engine then changes the machines state and sends it back to the frontend.

## Tech stack

* Node.js 14.x
* Symfony 5.x
* PHP 7.4
* React 16.x
* Docker

## Development setup

A docker based development setup is provided with the project.

Install composer packages.
```sh
docker-compose run phpfpm composer install
```

Install node js modules.
```sh
docker-compose run engine npm install
```

Edit engine configuration file(s).

```sh
cp engine/example_config.json engine/config.json
cp engine/plugins/ctrl/example_config.json engine/plugins/ctrl/config.json
```

This will start the engine and the frontend.
```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

*Install assets*
To install assets for the frontend we use Encore.

To watch for changes in the `assets/` folder, run:

```
docker run --volume $PWD:/app:delegated --workdir /app node:14 npm install
docker run --volume $PWD:/app:delegated --workdir /app node:14 npm run dev
```

@TODO: When trying to run `npm run dev` above -> npm ERR! code ELIFECYCLE --> npm ERR! errno 1
@TODO: Error: The "callback" argument of configureBabelPresetEnv() will not be used because your app already provides an external Babel configuration (e.g. a ".bab  elrc" or "babel.config.js" file or "babel" key in "package.json").

## Code Linting

When PRs are created towards the develop branch all coding styles are checked by Github Actions.

### Frontend

To check for coding standards, run the following:

```sh
docker run --volume $PWD:/app:delegated --workdir /app node:14 npm run check-coding-standards
```

@TODO: Warning: React version not specified in eslint-plugin-react settings

To automatically apply coding standards, run:

```sh
docker run --volume $PWD:/app:delegated --workdir /app node:14 npm run apply-coding-standards
```

### Engine

The same commands apply as frontend, be should be run from the `engine/` folder.

### Symfony

@TODO: Setup coding standards for the Symfony/PHP code.

## Testing

All tests runs with Github Actions for each PR to develop.

### Frontend

Frontend tests runs with jest.

```
docker run --volume $PWD:/app:delegated --workdir /app node:14 npm test
```

### Engine

Engine tests runs with mocha from the `engine/` directory. The tests that
call FBS are mocked with nock recordings.

```
docker-compose exec engine npm test
```

### Symfony

@TODO: Setup tests for the Symfony/PHP code.

## Production

### Building production assets for the frontend

```
docker run --volume $PWD:/app:delegated --workdir /app node:14 npm run build
```

@TODO: When trying to run `npm run build` above -> npm ERR! code ELIFECYCLE --> npm ERR! errno 1
@TODO: Error: The "callback" argument of configureBabelPresetEnv() will not be used because your app already provides an external Babel configuration (e.g. a ".bab  elrc" or "babel.config.js" file or "babel" key in "package.json").
